# Forms

React is not very good at two way data flow. Taking in user input is a guarantee that you need two way data flow, 
so forms become really difficult in React. To solve this problem we've made a `<Form />` component which is used much 
like the HTML Element `<form />`. It will hold the state of your form for you and track all the changes. When you're ready 
to submit the form, you call the Form's `submit()` function and it calls your `onSubmit` function with the form's state and 
any errors that may exist.

A basic form with a couple text inputs and a dropdown might look like this:

<Preview>
  <Story name='basic form'>
    <Form>
      <Stack spacing={12}>
        <TextInput path='name.first' label='First Name' />
        <TextInput path='name.last' label='Last Name' />
        <Button 
          label='Submit'
          ariaLabel='submit name'
          onClick={() => {
            //Call to form's submit function
          }} 
        />
      </Stack>
    </Form>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Submitting A Form

The form component provides its form and errors objects through an imperative handle. An imperative handle in react is a way to only 
expose specific functions to the parent of the component. In this case, the form provides a single `submit` function as part of its 
ref.

```jsx
const form = useRef()

const onSubmit = async ({ form, errors }) => {
  // form.name is the text input's value
  // errors.name is any error with the text input's value

  await fakeApi.post(form)
}

return (
  <Form ref={form} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <TextInput path='name' label='Name' />
    <Button label='Submit' onClick={() => form.current.submit()} />
  </Form>
)
```

In this example, `form.current.submit` is called when the Button is clicked on. When the function runs it calls the `onSubmit` 
function provided to `<Form />` as a prop. Sometimes, even though your form has been perfectly filled out by the user, 
there are still errors the server will let you know about. If you want those errors passed back to your inputs the `onSubmit`
function **must** return an errors object that uses the same paths as your inputs.

The example above can be modified to provide onSubmit validation errors as follows:

```jsx
const form = useRef()

const onSubmit = async ({ form, errors }) => {
  const results = await fakeApi.post(form)
  if (results.errors) {
    return results
  }
}

return (
  <Form ref={form} onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <TextInput path='name' label='Name' />
    <Button label='Submit' onClick={() => form.current.submit()} />
  </Form>
)
```

## Validation

As seen above, validation can run on submit. You also have the option of validating the whole form every time input changes.

```jsx
const form = useRef()

const validate = async ({ form }) => {
  const results = await fakeApi.validate(form)
  if (results.errors) {
    return results
  }
}

return (
  <Form ref={form} validate={validate}>
    <TextInput path='name' label='Name' />
    <Button label='Submit' onClick={() => form.current.submit()} />
  </Form>
)
```

The validate function needs to return the same type of `errors` object the onSubmit function returns. In the above example your errors object
would be  
```js
results.errors = {
  name: 'Please fill out your name'
}
```

If for some reason you need or want to see every change made to the form, you provide an `onChange` function.
This is a good way to inspect what's going on with form state as you build your forms. 

```jsx
const onChange = ({ form, errors }) => {
  /**
   * form = {
   *  name: string
   * }
   * 
   * errors = {
   *  name: string
   * }
   */
}

return (
  <Form onChange={onChange}>
    <TextInput path='name' label='Name' />
    <Button label='Submit' onClick={() => form.current.submit()} />
  </Form>
)
```
