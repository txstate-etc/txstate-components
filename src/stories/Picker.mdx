# Picker

```js
import { BasePicker } from "@txstate-mws/txstate-react/lib/components"
```


<Canvas>
  <Story name="picker">
    <BasePicker
      items={[
        { key: "red", name: "red" },
        { key: "orange", name: "orange" },
        { key: "yellow", name: "yellow" },
        { key: "green", name: "green" },
        { key: "blue", name: "blue" },
        { key: "indigo", name: "indigo" },
        { key: "violet", name: "violet" }
      ]}
      itemLimit={3}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## Props

If either `value` or `onChange` are provided, both must be provided. These props turn the picker into a controlled component.
