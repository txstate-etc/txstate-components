# Date Pickers

These components will let the user pick a date, time, or both.
The component is built from [@material-ui/pickers](https://material-ui-pickers.dev/)

## Format

Date format strings vary between libraries. The date pickers all use dayjs to track internal state. 
The [available tokens](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/blob/dev/docs/en/API-reference.md#list-of-all-available-formats) used in format strings are part of the DayJS docs.
You can escape characters by wrapping them in a pair of `[]`, if for some reason you need a character that is normally a formatting character.

| string          	|    result   	|
|-----------------	|:-----------:	|
| 'YYYY MM dd'    	|  2019 08 20 	|
| 'MMMM Do'       	| August 20th 	|
| '[Month] - MMM' 	| Month - Aug 	|

In the last example above, `M` and `h` would both produce values, but it's easier to wrap the entire word in brackets to escape all letters.

This format is how its displayed to the user, not how its stored in state.
